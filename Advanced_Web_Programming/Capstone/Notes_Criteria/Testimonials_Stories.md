Bright Forge Widgets
The following is a general dive into expectations on the site.

Pick 5 testimonials. One must be data specific.

Item 1: the WobbleTop - A desktop that balanced coffee cups, hold tangled charging cables. \
Item 2: The Doohickey - a sphere with a handle. Its just... a thing? \

Each design starts with "What If"
- Lets explore this: Submit ideas for "What if" button. 

The CTO: Amelia Cross - She wants something NEW. It cant be boring, it has to capture their essence. 

The Stakeholder statements are as follows: \
“I don’t want a bunch of duplicates showing up if they’re really just different colors of the same thing… I want the data to feel organized and clean, not cluttered.”
— Data Analyst, Survey Participant"

“The quantity field matters a lot, and it needs to handle negative numbers too, because that’s how backorders work in real life.”
— Inventory Manager, Internal Staff

“When I first click into the app, I don’t want to be greeted by something blank or confusing… I’d like a button that’s super obvious—like ‘See Widgets’—so I know where to click next.”
— College Student, Survey Participant

“For me, it is all about simplicity when it comes to images. If I need to add a picture of a widget, I do not want to deal with complicated steps or guess where the file ends up. I want to pick the image, upload it, and immediately see a preview or a clear link so I know it worked. I do not care if the file lives on a server or in the cloud. What matters is that it is easy, reliable, and consistent. If an image is too large or the wrong type, the app should tell me what is wrong and how to fix it, not just fail. Replacing an image should be a single action, and I should not have to reenter other data. Storing images should feel like attaching a file to an email: quick, obvious, and stress free. I just want to move on with my work without worrying about where the picture is or whether it will load correctly for users.”


“One thing I really care about is how the data gets presented when I’m looking at the widgets. I don’t want a bunch of duplicates showing up if they’re really just different colors of the same thing. It gets confusing when I see ‘WobbleTop’ listed five times, and I can’t tell if it’s five different widgets or just one widget in five colors. I’d like the data to be structured in a way where I can drill down — like I first see the main widget name, and then I can expand to see the colors, quantities, and ratings. That way I’m not overwhelmed by repeating info, but I still get all the details when I want them. Basically, I want the data to feel organized and clean, not cluttered.”

“For me, it’s all about the numbers. If I’m looking at the app and I see a widget, I want to know right away how many are actually in stock. And if something is permanently out of stock or marked as deleted, I don’t want it to just vanish without explanation — it should still show up with a label so I know it exists but isn’t available. The quantity field matters a lot, and it needs to handle negative numbers too, because that’s how backorders work in real life. If we have -3 of something, that tells me we’ve already promised three more than we have, and that’s critical information. I don’t want the system to round that away or hide it. I need the data to be real, even when it’s messy.”

“When I first click into the app, I don’t want to be greeted by something blank or confusing, because that makes me feel like I did something wrong or maybe the site isn’t finished. What would be really nice is if the very first page I see tells me right away, ‘This is Bright Forge Widgets.’ It doesn’t have to be over the top, but it should feel welcoming. Maybe a big picture in the background, something eye-catching, or a graphic that makes me think, oh okay, this is about widgets. And then right there on that same page, I’d like a button that’s super obvious—like ‘See Widgets’—so I know where to click next. I don’t want to guess where to go. I’m not going to dig through menus if I can’t find it quickly.”

“When I’m browsing the widgets, I really don’t want to read through one long list that looks like a spreadsheet. That’s too overwhelming and boring. I’d rather everything be in neat little boxes, almost like trading cards or product cards, because then I can scan the page faster. Each card should give me just enough—like the widget’s name, a short description so I know what it’s about, a rating so I can see if people think it’s good, and of course, a picture. The picture is super important. But if there isn’t one, don’t leave it empty because that makes it look like something broke. Just put in a default image so it feels consistent. It keeps the page looking complete even if the database doesn’t have an image for every widget.”

“As someone who’s still learning React, I look at components not just to use them but to understand how they’re put together. For me, the Card component would be a great place to add extra notes in the code. I’d love to see comments that explain the data flow—like where the props are coming from, how they’re being passed in, and how they end up rendering on the page. Sometimes I can kind of figure it out by trial and error, but it’s not always clear. Having those comments would be like having a little guide in the code itself, so I can follow along instead of feeling like I’m piecing together a puzzle with missing parts.”

“Search really matters to me, because I don’t always remember exactly what something is called. Like, maybe I saw a widget before and all I remember is the word ‘wobble.’ If I type that in, I want the app to show me everything that even remotely matches, whether it’s in the name or the description. Don’t make it so strict that it only finds exact matches, because that’s just frustrating. It should be forgiving and try to help me, not punish me for not remembering the exact name. Otherwise, I’ll probably think the widget isn’t even in the system when it actually is.”

“Color is a big deal for me. A lot of people match things to their setups, and I’m one of them. If I’m looking for a red widget, then I only want to see red ones. Having a filter for color makes it so much easier, because otherwise I have to scroll through everything hoping to spot what I want. And if I change my mind or just want to see all the widgets again, I don’t want to reload the whole site or clear out all my search terms manually. There should just be an easy way to clear the filter and go back to seeing everything. It saves me a lot of time and frustration.”

“Consistency is huge for me. If this is supposed to be Bright Forge’s app, then it should feel like Bright Forge from start to finish. That means using the same fonts, the same colors, the same design language everywhere. I don’t want the splash page to look modern and flashy, and then the results page to look plain or outdated. It has to all match. On the splash page especially, there should be a big, bold background and a short message about who we are and what makes our widgets special. That’s the first impression, and it should really set the tone for the whole app.”

“We sometimes run promotions, sales, or special announcements, and it would be really helpful to have space for that built right into the results page. I don’t mean something that takes over the whole screen, but maybe a banner spot above the grid where we could put a message or a graphic. It should fit in nicely without messing up the way the cards are displayed. That way, if we want to announce a discount or feature a new widget, we can do it in a way that looks professional and doesn’t break the layout.”

“From a testing perspective, the biggest issue I see is when there’s no feedback for the user. For example, if I search and nothing matches, I don’t want a blank screen that makes me think the app crashed. There should be a clear message that says something like, ‘No results found,’ and maybe give me a button to retry or clear the search. That way I know the app is working, but it just couldn’t find what I was looking for. It’s reassuring and also practical, because it saves people from wasting time wondering if it’s broken.”

“What I really don’t want to see is some ugly technical error message if the app goes down. If the server isn’t working or something fails, keep it friendly. Show me an error page that still looks like part of Bright Forge. It should use the same branding, and instead of gibberish or code, it should tell me in plain English what happened and give me a way to try again. I’m not technical, so if you throw a bunch of error codes at me, I’m just going to think the site is broken. A friendly message makes a big difference.”
