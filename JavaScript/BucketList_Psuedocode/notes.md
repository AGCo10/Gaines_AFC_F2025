## BucketList App

HTML = form

be able to see all items on load = <b>cRud</b> \

1 input = description of bucketlist item \
button = submit \
click submit \
create a new task = <b>Crud</b> \
be able to see all items on load = <b>cRud</b> \
"display it" back to the user at the end of the list \
toggle complete tasks = <b>crUd</b> \
be able to delete the bucketlist item from "database" = <b>cruD</b> \
how do we get data from form to JavaScript? \
Validation issues? -- have them resolved on the front end

## Code : What do we need? 
Create a fake database = array of objects \
object = TaskItem = represent our bucketlist item (task) \
array of bucketlist tasks = TaskList \

# functions (member)
Delete item() \
create item() \
update item() \
read item() 

# Research
How do I delete objects from arrays? \
How do I filter or sort an array? \
how do I toggle data in Javascript?

## Phase 10 = future functionality \
-- search function by person
